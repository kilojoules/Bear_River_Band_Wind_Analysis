<h1>Overview</h1>
This set of functions was used to forecast power for a local client. Electricity generation of an installed turbine was estimated using two sets of available data:
  AC Cumulative Output Energy Generation Data: The Rancheria has been recording electricity generation from cumulative measurements taken by the inverter connected to the installed Bergey Excel 10-kW turbine at the casino. The installed inverterâ€™s cumulative energy generation data were recorded for five years, August 2009 through August 2014.
  NREL Anemometer Data: Wind speed data was collected near the existing wind turbine using an anemometer loaned by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory
3 (NREL). Average wind speeds were recorded every ten minutes from December 2000 through November 2001.
Both sets of data were used to estimate power generated by an Aeolos H-50 and an Endurance E-3120 wind turbine at a hub height of 140 feet. Additionally, a Northern Power 100-kW turbine was forecasted at 120 feet due to the unavailability of a 140-ft tower from the manufacturer. The wind speed power curve specifications are hardwired into the wpcm function. The complete report in available in <code>Report.pdf.zip</code>.
